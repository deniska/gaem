# gaem - simple game programming library for python

Test repo please ignore.

Simple framework for building games in python. Uses SDL2. Hobby project. Very
far from being ready and usable. For now it's more of an offsite backup than
something you can use. No, seriously, there're hardcoded paths to my home dir
here. It barely builds on my computer, and yet one day I'm hoping to run this
thing on Android and iOS. Yes, I'm a fool.
